Thanks for suggesting an edit to the list! We just need a bit of information:

**Company name:**

**Are you sure this place has full-time developers on staff at all times? [Y/n]**

**Home page:**

**Career page:**

**Address:**

**Plus Code:**

<<>><<>><<>><<>><<>><<>><<>>

**Company name:** the name of the company you would like added to the list.

**Are you sure this place has full-time developers on staff at all times?** we only want companies that keep developers as full-time employees. Companies that exclusively keep developers as part-time employees or contractors should not be added.

**Home page:** the landing page of their website. (ex: `https://www.example.com/` or `https://example.com/`)

**Career page:** a direct link to a list of their open positions. (ex: `https://www.example.com/careers` or `https://example.com/about/open-positions`)

**Address:** the address of the company, excluding the company name but including the city, state, and ZIP code. When you search for a company in Google Maps, there's a button you can click to "Copy address." (ex: `123 E 6th St, Austin, TX 78701`)

**Plus Code:** underneath that button to "Copy address," there's another button in Google Maps to "Copy plus code." It also needs to include the city and state. (ex: `7795+4H Austin, Texas`)
